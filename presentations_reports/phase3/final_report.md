# UW-COSMOS ASKE-E Final Report

## Task 1: Scale and Enhance xDD Infrastructure and APIs

  #### Task 1.A. Expand Corpus
  The xDD corpus has grown to over 14.2M full-text publications. Springer-Nature was added as a new publisher partner in late 2021 and fetching of documents for this source began in October.

  #### Task 1.B. Developer Container Template for Collaboroator Code
  We developed and released a container template (https://github.com/UW-xDD/xdd-docker-recipe) to enable xDD collaborators to write code that that can be executed over xDD full-text content. The primary user of this template has been HMS, who has used this template to deploy the INDRA reading system over COVID-19 and other related documents in xDD. The output of the HMS container consists of grounded INDRA statements, which are dumped into Amazon S3 storage units for return back to HMS and the EMMAA model.
  
  #### Task 1.C. Augment xDD Corpus with Container Outputs
  
  #### Taks 1.D. Improve and Scale xDD API


## Task 2: Scle and Enhance COSMOS Retrieval and API
  
  #### Task 2.A. Improve Visual Segmentation
  #### Task 2.B. Incorporate Body-Text Content into Object Retrieval
  #### Task 2.C. Automatic Knowledge Base Construction
  #### Task 2.D. Release Public COSMOS API Over COVID-19 Set
