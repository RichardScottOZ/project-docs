# 1 The COSMOS Project
The goal of the UW-Madison COSMOS project is to develop a prototype knowledge base construction (KBC) system to automate key steps in the curation of scientific models from the scientific literature in an ongoing fashion as the scientific literature is produced. Here, we provide **a summary that outlines our accomplishments and challenges encountered during Phase 1**. We also provide an overview of the software and data products produced during Phase 1, with links to deliverables and documentation.

There were two primary tasks in this milestone, each with two deliverables:

###  Task 1: Extraction of Model Equations from Publications
#### 1. Development and deployment of barebone KBC system for scientific model curation.
Open-source release of KBC system and deployment on xDD for continuous ingestion of relevant input documents.

#### 2. Earth systems model KBC containing model specifications (equations).
Release of barebone-KB from ingested documents. Assessment and publication of system.

### Task 2: Extraction of Tables and Figures from Publications
#### 1. Refinement of code and deployment of table/figure extraction pipeline on xDD.
Open-source release of table/figure methods and deployment in xDD for continuous ingestion of relevant input documents.

#### 2. Construct Earth systems models KB containing model tables/figures.
Release of barebone-KB (with figures and tables) from ingested documents.
