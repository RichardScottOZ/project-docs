## Design and implementation of model equation and table/figure extraction methods
### Introduction
Here we provide an interim report on the design and implementation of our prototype system for automatically locating and extracting from the published literature data and information pertinent to scientific models. Two primary tasks constituted the focus of this project milestone:

1. Model equation extraction from scientific publications
2. Table/figure extraction from scientific publications

Both of these tasks required the development of methods to automatically visually segment, classify, and represent heterogeneous elements (i.e., equations, tables, figures, captions, body text blocks) within PDF documents in a way that maintains relationships to text-based information. These extracted elements and text must then be represented in a way that can be used in the next phase of the project (i.e., automated knowledge base construction).

Below, we first describe the general nature of the problem and our multimodal approach. Next, we document the software tools that were developed and/or modified to address the problem. We then provide initial quantitative results describing the recall and precision of equation, table, and figure element extraction from PDFs from multiple different commercial and open-access publications. The performance of our code and workflow and our ability to scale to multiple millions of documents in xDD infrastructure are also assessed.
