## Design and implementation of model equation and table/figure extraction methods

Here we provide an interim report on the design and implementation of our prototype system for locating and extracting data an information pertinent to scientific models from the scientific literature, with initial assessments of performance and scalability. There were two tasks associated with Milestone 2:

1. Model equation extraction from scientific publications
2. Table/figure extraction from scientific publications

Both of these tasks required the development of methods to automatically segment and classify elements in PDF documents in a way that maintains relation to text-based descriptions thereof.
