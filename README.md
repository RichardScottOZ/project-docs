# Goals and Approaches for TA1 Phases and Tasks

## Phase 1
### Task 1: Extraction of Models from Publications
Design and implement methods to extract models and semantically meaningful components of models that are reported in the literature in the form of equations. Incorporate weakly supervised KBC systems for such models into the ASKE pipeline.

### Task 2: Table and Figure Extraction
Develop methods that extend GDD with a scalable table and figure extraction engine that leverages state-of-the-art methods (i.e., the data model in Fonduer).

## Phase 2
### Task 1: Extraction of Model Metadata
Develop data extraction and integration methods to collect model metadata (from text) that corresponds to boundary conditions, sensitivity analyses, and results.

### Task 2: Data Extraction from Tables and Figures
Design and implement methods for 1) automatic extraction of model parameterizations from tables, and 2) extraction of data from  tables and figures. Implementation of methods that link data back to model code/output and the knowledge base developed  duringTask 1 will enable human-in-the-loop automated refinements of models.
